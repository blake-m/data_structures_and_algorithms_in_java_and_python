# Data Structures & Algorithms in Java & Python

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my journey through learning 
Data Structures & Algorithms. It also presents my Python & Java coding 
skills. Some of the Java code is based on William Fiset's (Google Software 
Engineer) code coming from his wonderful series of tutorials on DS&A.

## Worth mentioning: unit tests
- vast majority of my code, both in Java & Python, is covered with unit tests,
 mostly using TDD (Test Driven Development) approach.

### Data Structures implemented & well-known by me:
- Dynamic & Static Array
- Singly (Python) & Doubly Linked List (Java)
- Stack (Both)
- Queue (Java)

### Small projects:
- Tower of Hanoi in Python - my simple version of the game + algorithm solving it
